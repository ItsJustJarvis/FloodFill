# **FloodFill - JS Web Game**

## **Author:** Reeve Jarvis

### **Description:**
---
FloodFill is a JavaScript web game I created following tutorials and lessons provided in my Applied JavaScript course at NIC.
  
This project was meant to display the skills I have learned in modern JavaScript language features, including the use of JavaScript objects, multi-dimensional arrays and user interaction through the canvas.

### **How to play:**
---
**Goal:** Make all cells on the grid/board the same color.
  
- Choose a color by clicking on one of the labeled buttons at bottom of the grid.
- Click on a cell to change its color to the selected color.
- All neighbouring cells of the clicked-on cell's color will be changed to the selected color.
  
### **Scoring System:**
---
You get 5 points per cell changed on each click. When you fill the board your final score is calculated based on the number of clicks it took you to finish. Higher changes, higher rewards!
  
Your final score must be at least 200 points to beat the grid. Restart the same grid to try and beat your high score.
